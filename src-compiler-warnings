Martin,

I am currently building R-devel under the gcc trunk (pre-4.3.0) on
Windows.  (Not what I would usually recommend, but we are promised a MinGW
release of 4.2.0 Real Soon Now, and I can get prebuilt 'trunk'.
Hopefuilly before 2.5.1 we will be able to move to gcc4 on Windows, at
long last.)

I am seeing a lot of warnings from cluster along the lines of

gfortran -O3 -Wall   -c daisy.f -o daisy.o
Warning: Nonconforming tab character in column 1 of line 41
Warning: Nonconforming tab character in column 1 of line 42

I think you have entab-ed the files, so for the next release (no hurry at
all) could you please detab them.

Brian
